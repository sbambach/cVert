cVert is a MIDI controller which plays completely random notes based on the radioactive decay of radioisotopes.

Find out more about cVert [on my website](http://danny.makesthings.work/cvert) or [in this zine](https://github.com/walkerdanny/cVert/blob/master/documentation/zine.pdf).

All documentation, code, mechanical files, gerbers etc. are included in this repository. A list of libraries required to compile the software is included in the "electrical" directory.
